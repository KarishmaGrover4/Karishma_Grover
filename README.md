In my previous role as a Project Coordinator, I successfully managed complex projects from start to finish. This involved assigning tasks during the onboarding process, scheduling calls, and creating comprehensive plans to ensure timely delivery.

With strong communication skills, I excel at collaborating with cross-functional teams. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Applications, which has further enhanced my technical capabilities.

Prior to my Project Coordinator role, I worked in technical support for the E-commerce industry. This experience involved assisting clients through various channels, including chats, emails, and calls.
